Adrienne McGuire’s love for dance began as a child and she has been sharing her passion with her students for the past 23 years. She creates an environment which allows each student to learn, create and explore without judgment of their minds, bodies or abilities. Adrienne has taught throughout the Carolinas and Midwest, establishing positive and rewarding relationships with students and teachers alike.

Impressed with the caliber of dancers, Adrienne joined the CC & Company family in 2007 and has become a highly sought-after Ballet and Jazz instructor. She believes dance is for everyone, and her goal is to unleash the uniquely gifted dancer within each of her students. Adrienne is trained in classical Ballet, Jazz, Tap and Modern dance techniques and is an instructor who possesses a culmination of prestigious training, education, and experience.  She studied with the St. Louis Ballet, under the direction of the legendary ballet choreographers Master Antoni Zalewski and Mistress Ludmila Dokoudovsky and competed Jazz throughout the country, winning several local and national awards. After high school, she went on to earn a BFA in Dance from Stephen’s College in Columbia, Missouri, where she studied under the internationally recognized ballet master Michael Simms and was introduced to her new love, Modern dance. Among the many instructors who influenced her extensive Modern dance development are the renowned Janice Dulak, Paul Mosely, Sean Curran, and Judith Jamison.

More than her own accomplishments, Adrienne is most proud of her students, some of whom have attended highly acclaimed BFA programs and have gone on to become accomplished professional dancers, choreographers, and dance instructors. When she’s not dancing, Adrienne spends time with her husband Kris and their three beautiful children, Liam, Declan and Amelia.
